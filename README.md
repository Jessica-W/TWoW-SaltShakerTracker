# Salt Shaker Tracker

An addon to help you keep track of when your characters are able to use their salt shaker again. I wrote this because I had a bunch of characters with leatherworking whose salt shaker CDs were all out of sync.

## Usage

Log in with each of your characters that can use a salt shaker so the addon knows when the CD will be up. Then whenever a character is able to use their salt shaker a message will be displayed in your General chat tab. You can also use /sscd to display a list of every character the addon is tracking and when the salt shaker CD will be available for each one.
